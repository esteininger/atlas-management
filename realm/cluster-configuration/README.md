# Steps

1. Get your API private key, public key, and group ID and place each individually in the Values section of Realm
2. Create a new function, paste the pause.js and resume.js files in the code editor
3. Create a Scheduled Trigger, which runs at a set cadence and have it call the functions created in step 2
